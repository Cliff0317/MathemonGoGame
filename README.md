# Mathemon Go Game
## Introduction
Perhaps you have seen the famous "Pokemon Go", but battling... isn't so educational.
Thus, I created the "Mathemon Go" game (first version: text-based, later versions using pygame will be released).
## Prerequisite
Please install any text editor that supports python and download my code.
No packages required to be installed.
Personally, I use pycharm because it is great.
## Improvements
"Battle" command not created yet.
